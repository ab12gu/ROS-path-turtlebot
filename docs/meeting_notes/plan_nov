NOTE: robot radius 0.220
-> notes on environment change in ROS
(By: Friday at noon) *do tomorrow

Dylan
-> Port script python
-> Turtlebot communcation for wheel commands
-> Test feed forward trajectory (use opti.pkl)
**-> Implement feedback controller

Check point: robot can track and follow a trajectory without human/external sources
(sat)

Restart
-> figure out camera outputs
-> output is z = (x, y, d)
-> How to find Ax+Bu equation for a person (give grid of depth values)
-> What needs to be done with probability distribution (i.e. how to make decisions)

Meet with Banerjee Thursday(** Dylan off campus 11-12 (prefer after 1))
