Start with running:
$ roscore

Run simulation environment w/ turtlesimulation node inside it
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

Moving turtle command
$ rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key #allows movement through arrow keys

Inside the scenes:
- turtle_teleop_key is publishing the keystrokes on a topic
- turtlesim subscribes to the same topic to receive the key strokes

Download rqt graph
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt-common-plugins

run rqt graph
$ rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph

Rostopic: (allows you to get information about ROS topics)
$ rostopic -h (for help)
$ rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel #returns value of cmd for topic
# need to push arrow keys again to see return values

Return description of all active topics
$ rostopic list -v

Type of message needs to be same for publisher and subscriber to send message
$ rostopic type [topic]
$ rostopic type /turtle1/cmd_vel
returns: /geometry_msgs/Twist
$ rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist #returns details of message

Send a direct message to turtlebot:
$ rostopic pub [topic] [msg_type] [args]
$ rostopic pub -1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, 1.8]'

Details::::
This command will publish messages to a given topic:
- rostopic pub
This option (dash-one) causes rostopic to only publish one message then exit:
- -1 
This is the name of the topic to publish to:
- /turtle1/cmd_vel
This is the message type to use when publishing to the topic:
- geometry_msgs/Twist
::::: #YAML syntax for numbers input


Turtle needs a steady stream of commands at 1 Hz to keep moving
$ rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 1 -- '[2.0, 0.0, 0.0]' '[0.0, 0.0, -1.8]'
# BIG NOTE Each command runs only for a second; therefore lower than 1 hz commands will have pauses..

See data published to turtlesim:
$ rostopic echo /turtle1/pose

Rate at which data is published:
$ rostopic hz [topic]
$ rostopic hz /turtle1/pose
- shows data is published at a rate of 60 hz?

Depth information:
$ rostopic type /turtle1/cmd_vel | rosmsg show

Plotting position
$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot
- To see plots of x, y on graph:-- add /turtle1/pose/x && /turtle1/pose/y && /turtle1/pose/theta
